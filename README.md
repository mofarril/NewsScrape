# NewsScrape

PURPOSE: This app is created to scrape all the latest NPR News website.

OVERVIEW: We have used Node JS, Express JS, handlebars, mongoDB, cheerio and axios. We have created handlebars as a webpage and on different button clicks we are calling different GET and POST ajax functions to scrape data to the web page. We have also included an option to comment on a particular article. Users can view all the comments and delete the comments too if they want. We have used axios to pull the latest news headlines, summary and link to the every news page.

HOW TO USE: User will navigate to the app and click the button 'scrape new articles'. It will pull all the latest news. Users are also able to see old news on the app and read, post and delete comments by clicking the comment button right next to each article. Users can also view the full news by clicking on the link provided with every news.



TECHNOLOGIES USED: Node JS, Express JS, Handlebars, MongoDB, Cheerio, Axios.

MY ROLE: This app is solely developed by me from start to end.
